## Hi there

I'm Mike — a builder who enjoys creating systems, improving workflows, and developing practical solutions that make work more efficient. My background spans real estate, digital operations, and community management, and I like working on projects where organization and problem-solving matter.

Here are some quick points:

- I’m currently working on refining my personal workflow tools and small automation projects.
- I’m currently learning more about system design, data structure fundamentals, and improving development habits.
- I’m looking to collaborate on practical tools, workflow improvements, and projects that focus on efficiency.
- Ask me about process organization, workflow optimization, or project structure.
- How to reach me: phyomoutsoe.fo@gmail.com
- Pronouns: he/him
- Fun fact: I often rebuild my own systems just to make them cleaner and simpler.
